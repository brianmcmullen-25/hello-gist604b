# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Brian McMullen  
**Date:** 26 Oct 2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
1. I learned how to navigate GitHub’s interface. I also learned how to create repositories, organize folders, and manage files using Markdown. Going forward, I think I now understand the visibility and structure of professional code repositories.
2. I learned how to use branches and pull requests to manage changes without disrupting the main project. This showed how version control keeps collaborative work organized.
3. I learned that Issues help teams collaborate by serving as a shared task board—where team members can assign work, discuss bugs, and track progress transparently.
4. I learned that documentation matters because it explains how a project works, how to contribute, and why decisions were made. Clear README files and comments make open source projects accessible to new users and contributors.

## Challenges and Solutions
1. One challenge I faced was understanding how to structure folders and files in my repository. At first, my files were in the wrong directory, but I fixed it by reorganizing my repo.txt. I also reviewed the example layout in the assignment instructions.
2. Another challenge was learning Markdown syntax for formatting headings, links, and bullet points. I overcame this by using GitHub’s Markdown preview and documentation to practice and correct my formatting.

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills are directly useful in my potential GIS career because many GIS tools, scripts, and workflows, especially those involving Python, ArcGIS API, or QGIS plugins, are shared on GitHub. Being more comfortable with repositories and version control will help me build a professional portfolio. I will also have the opportunity to collaborate on code with other analysts and contribute to open source GIS projects that support the broader geospatial community.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
